Welcome to your first Eto.Forms cross-platform application!

To get started, ensure you use Program.Main() as your program startup.

Here's a breakdown of what's included:

MainForm.cs - Contains your main form
Program.cs 	- Your startup code

The build output will include an .app bundle (folder) to distribute to your Mac users.
If you install mono, the .app bundle will also include the mono runtime so your Mac users
won't have to install anything to run your application.

This framework can be used to build applications that run across multiple platforms using
their native toolkit using a single UI codebase. This will make your applications look and
work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping
your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a
custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across
Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.
